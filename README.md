- 👋 Hi, I’m @george2209. 
* First time programming: 1990
* Experience: C++/JAVA mostly.
* Area of expertise: automotive (no connection with any of my projects here)
* Current job: eng manager with business development support.
* What peoples I like: pasioned peoples about their work.
* Dislike: lies-> I can understand & accept all other human defects :)) but this.

- 👀 My repositories are hobby projects. The active one at this moment is a small game based on that I build a platform that I make for kids easier to understand and 
create their own content. I do this only for fun..so if you want to join me make sure you have one of those skills:
* OpenGL or Vulkan or Metal
* Blender or any graphic vector skills 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with other peoples with the upper mentioned project. We will do all on SCRUM based (I am a certified PO in SCRUM so you will learn a lot from me)

What is my target with this? --> Create a framework where someone (even kids) with some minimum programming skills can fast and easily build some little 3D games. All is 3D using 
perspective view.

- 📫 How to reach me? See any java file inside the PlanesAndShips project for my email address. Make sure you have time and you are motivated for learning and active participating to
the current team build. We are requesting at least 4 hours per week from you (including 30 min SCRUM meetings). I also have limited time per week so I will understand any 
limitation as long as you are motivated to learn or build this ;).
